# Example 3 - Basic operations with variables

# Let's define a real and an integer number
x1=2.0
x2=3

# Sum of a real and an integer number
y=x1+x2
# The result is a real number!
print(y)

del y

# Multiplication between a real and an integer
y=x1*x2
# The result is a real number again!
print(y)

del y

# Division between a real and an integer
y = x1/x2
# The result is a real number again!
print(y)

del y

# And vice versa 
y = x2/x1
# The result is a real number again!
print(y)

del y
# Rest of the division
y = x1%x2
print(y)

# Integer of the division
y = x1//x2
print(y)

# The power of a numbers
y = x1**x2
print(y)

# Exercise: What happens if the numbers are both integers?
